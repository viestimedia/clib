// import css from './component.module.css' // Breaks the entire build

// ChatGPT:

// Thank you for providing the built output. Based on the generated code, it seems that the issue might be related to how the CSS modules are being used in your component library.

// In the generated code, the CSSModule component is defined correctly as a function component, and it exports the expected JSX code. However, the className prop for the p element is set to cr.component, which is an object ({ component: fr }) instead of a string.

// This suggests that the CSS module is not being resolved correctly during the build process, and the class name is not being assigned to the className prop as expected.

// To resolve this issue, you need to make sure that the CSS module is properly configured and integrated with Vite and React. Here are a few steps to check:

// CSS Module Configuration: Verify that you have correctly set up CSS modules in your Vite configuration (vite.config.ts). Ensure that you have the necessary plugins and configurations for CSS modules, such as @vitejs/plugin-react, sass, and postcss.

// CSS Module Naming: Check the naming convention for your CSS module files. By default, Vite uses the [name].[hash:8].[ext] pattern to generate unique class names for CSS modules. Make sure that your CSS module files are named with the .module.css extension and that they follow the naming convention to enable CSS module resolution.

// Importing CSS Module: Verify that you are importing the CSS module correctly in your component file (CSSModule.tsx). Ensure that you use the import styles from './CSSModule.module.css' syntax to import the CSS module and assign it to the styles variable.

// Applying CSS Module Classes: Double-check that you are using the CSS module classes correctly in your JSX code. In the dr function component, make sure that you apply the CSS module class name using the styles object. For example, change className: cr.component to className: styles.component to correctly reference the CSS module class.

// After making these adjustments, rebuild your component library using Vite, and then try using the CSSModule component in your Next.js or Remix application to see if the server rendering issue is resolved.

// If the issue persists or you encounter any specific error messages, providing additional information or code snippets related to the CSS module configuration and usage would be helpful for further assistance.
